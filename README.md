# React Rive Shimmers

Basic example project bootstrapped by the create-react-app project that showcases integrating Rive to make a simple Shimmer component for building placeholder layouts. This is ideal for times in an app when you don't wan't to show a generic loader, but rather a loading state of the layout of the UI that would eventually render in.
